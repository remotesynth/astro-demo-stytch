# CFP Tracker using Stytch

This is a WIP of a conference session/CFP tracker built as an SSR site with Astro and using a combination of AppWrite cloud for the backend and Stytch for authentication.

Note that many aspects aren't fully implemented in the code including handling authentication errors, redirecting all pages if the user is not logged in and consolidating the Stytch code into a library to allow reuse of the client.
